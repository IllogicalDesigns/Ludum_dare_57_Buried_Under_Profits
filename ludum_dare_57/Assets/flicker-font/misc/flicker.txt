Flicker is a set of fonts based on a type of alphanumeric display, consisting
of segmented pixels, and sometimes seen in airports or on trains.
The set consists of several fonts; these are:

  Flicker - the basic alphanumeric font set.  
    Lowercase is a copy of uppercase; there are no accented characters.

  FlickerDamaged - A version of Flicker simulating a malfunctioning 
    display.  Some segments are missing; others elsewhere are lit.

  Flicker03 - A version of Flicker with only the bottom 3 rows visible.

  Flicker15 - A version of Flicker with only the top 4 rows visible.

  FlickerRandom - A font based on the segmented display grid used in Flicker,
    only each character has a random assortment of pixels lit.  Different
    characters have different densities of lit pixels, and may be overlaid.

The Flicker font set is monospaced; consequently, characters from different
fonts may be overlaid to achieve multi-layered effects.

Note: Flicker is intended as a display font only, and is not suitable for 
setting text.  The designer takes no responsibility for use or misuse of 
this font set.

This font set is freeware; if you find it useful, the designer requests that 
you make a small donation to the Electronic Frontier Foundation 
(http://www.eff.org/) or the Free Software Foundation (http://www.fsf.org/).
